.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility performs various actions on sprite archives.
The following commands are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Nm Fl l Ar version Oo Fl fouv Oc Oo Fl m Ar anmmap Oc Ns Ar ... Ar archive
Displays a specification of the archive.
.It Nm Fl x Ar version Oo Fl fouv Oc Ar archive Op Ar
Extracts image files.
If no files are specified, all files are extracted.
.It Nm Fl r Ar version Oo Fl fouv Oc Ar archive Ar name Ar file
Replaces an entry in the archive.
The name can be obtained by the
.Fl l
command.
.It Nm Fl c Ar version Oo Fl fuv Oc Oo Fl m Ar anmmap Oc Ns Ar ... Oo Fl s Ar symbols Oc Ar archive Ar input
Creates a new archive from a specification obtained by the
.Fl l
command.
It will look for referenced image files in the current directory.
.It Nm Fl V
Displays the program version.
.El
.Pp
These options are accepted:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
The
.Fl f
option can be used to ignore certain errors.
.It Fl m Ar anmmap
The
.Fl m
option can be used to map ins_* to human readable names.
.It Fl s Ar symbols
The
.Fl s
option saves symbol ids to the
.Ar symbols
file.
.It Fl o
The
.Fl o
option adds address information for ANM instructions.
.It Fl u
The
.Fl u
option extracts each texture into a separate file.
When specified twice, x/y offset is ignored.
See
.Sx IMAGE COMPOSITION
for more information.
.It Fl v
The
.Fl v
option increases verbosity of the output.
It can be specified multiple times.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with 0 on success, 1 on error.
.Sh IMAGE COMPOSITION
Each texture in an ANM file has an associated source image filename.
By default
.Nm
creates textures by cropping the source image
according to the following parameters:
.Va xOffset ,
.Va yOffset ,
.Va THTXWidth ,
.Va THTXHeight .
When extracting the textures, the process is reversed.
However, because multiple textures may come from a single source file,
they have to be composed together during extraction.
Additionally, in either case, the textures have to be converted to/from
the appropriate format.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Composition when creating Po Fl c Pc or replacing Po Fl r Pc :
The source image is read from a file, decoded as PNG, cropped,
and encoded in the texture format.
.It Composition when extracting Po Fl x Pc :
Each texture is decoded into RGBA, and placed on a canvas.
The canvas is encoded as PNG and written to the destination file.
.El
.Pp
Currently there's no way to compose textures from multiple ANM files.
.Pp
The
.Fl u
option extracts each texture into its own file.
It's important to also use the
.Fl u
option for listing
.Pq Fl l ,
because
.Fl c
relies on the alternative filenames being specified in the spec file.
Even with
.Fl u
the images are cropped/padded when they have an offset.
The
.Fl uu
option ignores the offset, thereby disabling cropping/padding.
.Pp
In TH19, the textures are stored using PNG and JPEG compression.
.Nm
tries to avoid recompression when possible,
so composition is only done when necessary.
Uncompressed textures (pre-TH19) are always composed,
even if only to convert them to PNG.
PNGs are only composed only if there's a nonzero offset,
or there are multiple textures referencing the same image.
Otherwise the file is copied directly, without recompression
.Pq Fl uu No forces this behavior .
JPEGs are
.Em never
composed, but it shouldn't be necessary either.
If a JPEG has to be composed,
.Nm
will issue a warning.
.Sh "ANMMAP FILE FORMAT"
Anmmap files, which are added with the
.Fl m
option, consist of two kinds of lines: control lines (which start with
.Ql \&! Ns
), and mapping lines.
.Pp
The file starts with
.Ql !anmmap
control line.
The rest of the control lines select the mapping that is being modified:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ql !ins_names
Instruction names.
This is the default mapping.
.br
Value: identifier
.It Ql !ins_signatures
Instruction signatures.
.br
Value: signature
.It Ql !gvar_names
Global variable names.
.br
Value: identifier
.It Ql !gvar_types
Global variable types.
.br
.No Value: type ( Ns
.Ql $
for integer,
.Ql %
for float)
.El
.Pp
Mapping lines are always of form
.D1 Oo Ar key Oc Oo Ar value Oc
where
.Ar key
is an integer, and
.Ar value
is a string without spaces.
Empty values are allowed.
.Pp
When multiple mappings are specified for the same key or value,
the most recent one has priority.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
123 foo
123 bar
.Ed
.Pp
will map
.Ql 123
to
.Ql bar Ns
,
.Ql bar
to
.Ql 123 Ns
, and
.Ql foo
to
.Ql 123 Ns
\&.
Note how the first reverse mapping doesn't get removed.

.Sh BUGS
A few files from TH12 and TH13 contain overlapping entries
with different formats.
Dumping and recreating these archives will not result in the same archives.
The affected pixels seem to all have 0 for alpha though.
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
File names may not be properly sanitized when extracting.
Furthermore, invalid data may not be properly handled.
Do not operate on untrusted files.
